0.  pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is the longest word in this problem set's dictionary. It is also fun to pronounce.

1.  Returns resource usage measures for its parameter 'who'

2.  16

3.  Because C requires passing structs by reference in functions, because by value, the size would be too big

4.  Speller.c reads words from the file, character by character, using a for loop to begin reading the first character of 
    the file, incrementing by one character until it reaches the end of the file. If the character is a letter or apostrophe,
    it is added to a word. If the word becomes larger than what we have defined as the largest word possible, the word is
    ignored. If the word has a digit, it is ignored as well.
    
    If a word still exists, it is counted, checked for spelling, and printed. The amount of time it takes to complete the
    checking is logged in ti_check.    

5.  To be able to account for numerical inputs and other punctuation which we have deemed invalid.

6.  Because word LENGTH and DICTIONARY are #MACRO declared as constants (word is an array of LENGTH+1)

7.  Trie using Linked list. Each of my node contains 27 pointers to hold child nodes and one boolean value that indicates 
    if it is a end of word.

8.  Very fast till I was using my custom text. But the thing was it ran perfect at the first try. :)

9.  Reduced some repeating operation and instruction optimizations.
    
10. Nothing in the world in made perfect, not even my code. Although I could not find any flaw or limitation but there
    must be some way to make it better.
